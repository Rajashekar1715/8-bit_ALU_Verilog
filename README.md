# 8-bit ALU in Verilog

This is a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implemented in Verilog. It performs 8 operations on two 8-bit inputs.

## Operations

| Code | Operation     |
|------|---------------|
| 000  | Addition       |
| 001  | Subtraction    |
| 010  | AND            |
| 011  | OR             |
| 100  | XOR            |
| 101  | Shift Left     |
| 110  | Shift Right    |
| 111  | Pass-through A |

## Test Inputs

a = 15, b = 3
